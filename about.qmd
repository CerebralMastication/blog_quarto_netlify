Hey y'all. This is the personal blog of James David Long (aka JD Long). This blog in no way represents the views of my employer, my wife, or my dog, Sparky. My views shared here are my take on what I see in the world around me with an emphasis on technology, computing, data, and occasionally agriculture.

I can be seen at tech conferences running my mouth and trying to share with others the lessons I've learned so I can help spare them some pain. Here's a selection of a few times someone had a recording device rolling when I ran my mouth:
